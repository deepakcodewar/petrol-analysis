# petrol-analysis
In this project I have solved some real life problems. 
Queries are->  
1)In real life what is the total amount of petrol in volume sold by every distributor?  
2)Which are the top 10 distributors ID’s for selling petrol and also display the amount of petrol sold in volume by them individually?  
3)The constraint to this query is the difference between volumeIN and volumeOuT is illegal in real life if greater than 500. 
As we see all distributors are receiving petrols on every next cycle. List all distributors who have this difference, along 
with the year and the difference which they have in that year.
